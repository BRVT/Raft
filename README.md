# Raft
Raft is a consensus algorithm designed as an alternative to the Paxos family of algorithms.
Raft offers a generic way to distribute a state machine across a cluster of computing systems, ensuring that each node in the cluster agrees upon the same series of state transitions. 
It uses 5 server with 1 as an elected leader.
